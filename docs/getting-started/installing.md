_To help you get started Cavy provides a command-line interface (called
cavy-cli) which makes it easier to get set up and run your tests. You can't use
the CLI if you use Expo. In which case, skip the CLI installation step and just
install `cavy`._

To get started with Cavy, install **cavy-cli** globally using yarn or npm:

    yarn global add cavy-cli

Add Cavy to your React Native project as a development dependency:

    yarn add cavy --dev

### Using TypeScript

If you're using TypeScript, you'll also need to install the types package:

    yarn add @types/cavy
